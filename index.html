        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <p>
            The night Hector's egg was laid is said to be the most horrific of nights
            since the heavens were raised. The sky cracked as lightning ripped through like
            a rip cord heralding death. Thunder screeched as if Beann'shies were coming for all.
            It poured so violently even the earth wept as all perished. <br>
            All but one...
